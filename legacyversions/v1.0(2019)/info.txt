HTML Studio 2019 Series

These programs were developed in July 2019 and do almost the same thing. Developed for a summer class demonstration.
These programs all are mostly the same, except a minor cosmetic difference and their ability to save HTML files. The
main formats these programs can save:
- HTM
- HTML
- HTML-E (a special format for the Enterprise skew)

The program came in four skews. All of them are free, so I recommend using the Enterprise skew ('cuz when will you ever get enterprise-level programs again?)

-- System Requirements --
OS: Windows 7 or later (Vista MIGHT work, if it's x64.)
CPU: 64-bit processor
RAM: 256 megabytes
HDD: 20 gigabytes (2 megabytes for install)

This was a late program of my early era of programs.
