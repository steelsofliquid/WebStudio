# WebStudio
SteelsOfLiquid's WebStudio (I couldn't think of a better name) web-building suite. Not very impressive, but it works on Windows 2000.
This repository contains HTML Studio, CSS Studio, and other programs. Please be aware that these programs may freak out some services because for whatever reason, I didn't put it there, but it compiles with what ONLY ONE antivirus claims is a trojan, but it's only one and it's not anything like Microsoft or Google or whatnot.

__Legacy versions__

Repository not only contains the latest versions, but also:
- _HTML Studio 2019 (SteelsOfLiquid under the TeraHFSS badging)_
